# Tableau Disney+ Hotstar Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains the Tableau project where I performed data analysis on the Disney+ Hotstar dataset. The analysis includes various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualizations such as total movies and TV shows by year, movies and TV shows by distribution, ratings distribution, total movies and TV shows by year, and the top 10 genres.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Disney+ Hotstar, providing valuable information about their content offerings. It includes details about movies and TV shows, including release year, distribution, ratings, and genre information.

## Analysis Highlights

1. Total Movies and TV Shows by Year:
   - Visual representation of the distribution of movies and TV shows over the years.

2. Movies and TV Shows by Distribution:
   - A breakdown of content distribution across various platforms or distributors.

3. Ratings Distribution:
   - A visualization of how ratings are distributed across the content.

4. Total Movies and TV Shows by Year:
   - A different perspective on the distribution of content by year.

5. Top 10 Genres:
   - A detailed view of the top 10 genres based on content availability.

## Tableau Workbook

The Tableau workbook file (`disney+ dashboard tableau.twb`) contains the dashboards and visualizations generated during the analysis.
